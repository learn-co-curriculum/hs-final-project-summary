## Final Project Summary

Here's a recap of what you need to know for your final project:

### Ideation
Your first step is to figure out what you want to build for your final project. At the Flatiron School we love to focus on building things that are *useful* and that make people's lives easier. We'll start from there...

+ Pick a perspective. Who do you want to build for? Your friends? Your mom? Your grandparents? When we 'ideate' we have to have a strong perspective to approach problems from.

+ Ok, now you've chosen your perspective. Write down everything you can think of about this person or group of people. What do they love? What do they hate? What are big (or little) problems that this person faces in their lives?

+ Cool. Pick a problem and start thinking of a app-centric solutions that you might want to build. Here are tools that will be at your disposal:

1. Forms for taking in data from a user.
2. Scraping (pulling data out of existing websites)
3. Text messaging capabilities.
4. Emailing capabilites.
5. (Advanced) Database to store data

+ Start wireframing! What is your app going to do? What will your app look like? Come up with plans, and then run them by a teacher to make sure that they are feasible to accomplish in the next few weeks.
